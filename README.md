# Multi-Agent Pacman Project

This repository contains the code for Project 2 of the CS 188 Summer 2024 course, where we implemented various multi-agent search algorithms to control Pacman and his ghostly adversaries. The project includes implementations of Reflex, Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax agents, as well as a custom evaluation function.

## Project Overview

In this project, we design agents for the classic Pacman game, now including ghost adversaries. The tasks involve implementing both minimax and expectimax search algorithms, enhancing the Reflex agent, and designing an evaluation function to optimize Pacmanâ€™s gameplay.

## Setup Instructions

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have Python installed. The following Python packages are required:

- `pygame` (for graphical display)
- `numpy` (for numerical computations)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
